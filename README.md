The full name of this project would be "Data Science Base Models and Bootcamp". It is the base of real data science projects.

The project try to unify the interface of every Machine Learning Model, both for classification and regression. The final goal is to wrap them by the LCModel, wich is the called "Learning Curves Model". Such model, is designed to systematically determinate if a model has high Variance (overfitting), or in the other hand, high Bias.
